# perpendicular-tangents-to-parabola
 Assuming two tangents of a parabola intersect perpendicularly. Then what is the relation between the intersection point and the parabola?

# Dependencies
 - You just need to import 'math' library.

# How-to-use
 - The code points out what it needs in English before every input phase.

# The-backstory
 - While listening my teacher in mathematics class, I realized an interesting similarity between two formulas and the example of how to find the intersection point of two perpendicular tangents of a parabola. Then I worked on that for a few hours and finally found this : 
   - If the tangents drawn from the point P(d, e) to the parabola y = ax^2 + bx + c intersect perpendicularly:
    - b = ± √[4a(c-e) – 1] 
 - It looks very simple but I thought that it could be a game-changer for complex computer algorithms. Now, I'm publishing the first step of a potential practical usage of this formula.

# Edition
- **** After couple of days or weeks after publishing, I realized that proof of that equation is very simple and same as the more commonly known and used version of it. Therefore, there is nothing that important as I claimed above, but still I will keep it same. ****
